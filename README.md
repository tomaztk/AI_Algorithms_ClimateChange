Abstract
Climate change is a fact, it is happening, and we need not only actively participate in tackling it, but also we need to raise awareness. One area that can be identified is the area of using and implementing machine learning algorithms and techniques to tackle climate change. Addressing this issue can be done using machine learning and different approaches to tackling it, from mitigating or reducing and stopping CO2 emissions or adapting to the changes that climate change will bring. With the help of Microsoft Azure services, we will go through some of the machine learning concepts and how Azure can help us address, reduce, adapt to these issues or which tools can be found in Azure to help take actions and address policies. The session will look into climate change modeling, efficient sensing, biodiversity, solar geo-modeling, transportation, and electricity with the help of Machine Learning and Microsoft Azure.

# The heat is on!
7.500 major disaster events were recorded in past 20 years
Claiming 1.2 milion lives, BUT affecting 4.2 billion people
Result is approx.  3 trillion USD losses in global economic

In 2019 alone we recorder aw the highest CO2 emissions in human history.

Each segment will have a proposed Microsoft Azure architecture

## Approaches for tackling climate change
 
Tackling issues
•	 Predicting rare events
•	 Scheduling the renewables
•	 Accelerating forestation
•	 Image analysis and neural networks

### 1.1 Predicting rare events
Decision forests
Numerical simulations
GBM
Boosting algorithms for better recall-precision balance (AdaCost, PNRule)
Corresponding short-term predictions for chaotic systems
Multifidelity stohastic computational models (HiFi Monte Carlo + LoFi Markov chain)

### 1.2 Scheduling and planning the renewables
Short- and medium-term forecasting of consumption (historical data, physical and image data)
Decision-focused forecasting
Reinforcement learning to accomodate system balacing
Enabling decentralized optimization for solar and wind production using control theory with enforced deep learning
Wind turbines optimization, Peak-shaving

### 1.3 Accelerating forestation
Land abandoment detection (CNN on Landsat or Sentinel)
Remote sensing for deforestation (Open forrest project)
Illegal and optimal selective logging 
Mapping plantations and succesional forests (Random Forest, SVM, ANN)
Remote sensing datasets (Landsat optical data, ALOS/PALSAR L-band, Lidar)
Canopy height model (CHM)
Categorization of light detection and ranging vegetation

### 1.4 Image Analysis
Understanding land and land use attributes
Machine Learning for Remote sensing
•		Satellite images
•		Aerial or drone imagery (LiDAR, color images, etc)
•		Object detections
•		Semantic segmentation
•		Spatio-temporal forecasting
•		Super-resolutioning or image pixelization
Personas and technology

# Mitigating and reducing 
CO2 emissions
 
Mitigations and lowering CO2
•	 Farms and agriculture
•	 Transport
•	 Buildings and cities

## 2.1 Farms and agriculture
Optimization algorithms for precision agriculture
LiDar and remote sensoring for (over) heating and soil structure and management
Agricultural desease detection and invaluable crop detection
Neural Networks for water and crop management using IoT
Crop yield predictions using aerial data to improve moisture, fertilization and natural nutrient level

## 2.2 Transport

Theory based residual neural network (ResNet)
Spatiotemporal topic model
Discovering latent activity patterns on spatiotemporal data
Modelling transport demands and calculating impact on shared mobility concepts
Optimizing freight routing and bundling
Improving EV and low-carbon transportation

## 2.3 Buildings and cities
Shock responsive dwellings and cities for drought with remote sensing and local administrative data
Flood cities remote sensing using drone technology
Identification of foundation | construction | complete buildings
Resilient housing for retrofit possibilities for landslides or hurricanes
Urban tree canopy for better greenery, temperature and lifestyle 

Personas and technology

## Adapting to changes

 
What can we do today?
The green plan for EU 2050

 - Combat the negative impact of AI on the climate
 - Educate their employees on the criticality of climate change and explain how AI can make a real difference
- Establish technological foundations for AI-powered climate change action
 - Scale specific use cases
 - Collaborate with the climate change ecosystem
 

### Humanitarian response
Probability models for predicting crisis (drought, flood, fire, avalanches)
Crisis are decentralized; help usually is not
Before hand humanitarian response plan
Triggered release of cash (case of Bangladesh and flooding in 2020)
Impact on society and humans
Drought impacts the agriculture
Sea level impacts and threatens coastal cities
Local crisis have global impacts and global crisis have local impacts
Lowering GHG and GHG emissions will have contra-effect
Abandon the usage of fossil fuels will have impact on other natural resources (less fossil, more wind and solar)

### Key take-aways


### Stay aware!
