## Section 2





### Pollution

"Better air quality has led to a significant reduction of premature deaths over the past decade in Europe. However, the European Environment Agency's (EEA) latest official data show that almost all Europeans still suffer from air pollution, leading to about 400,000 premature deaths across the continent.”
“Exposure to fine particulate matter caused about 417,000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2018, according to the EEA assessment.” (Source: Marked improvement in Europe's air quality over past decade, fewer deaths linked to pollution — European Environment Agency (europa.eu))

## 

### Heat and Drought

The earth is now 1.2 °C warmer than it was in the late 1880s. The current path of carbon dioxide emissions will increase global temperatures by 3-5°C by the end of the century.
With 3°C global warming in 2100, 90,000 Europeans could die from extreme heat annually. (Source: Human mortality from extreme heat and cold | EU Science Hub (europa.eu))
660,000 additional asylum applications per year in the EU (at 5°C temperature increase).
16% of species at risk of extinction (at 4.3°C temperature increase). More data can be found at: UN Report: Nature's Dangerous Decline 'Unprecedented'; Species Extinction Rates 'Accelerating' – United Nations Sustainable Development

### Economics

If no further action is taken and global temperature increases by 3.5°C, climate damages in the EU could amount to at least €190 billion, a net welfare loss of 1.8% of its current GDP. (Source: Impacts of climate change | EU Science Hub (europa.eu))
Global crop and economic models projected a 1–29% cereal price increase in 2050 due to climate change, which would impact consumers globally through higher food prices. (Source: Mbow, C., et.al, 2019: Food Security. In: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems.)

### Floods

Globally, the number of people at risk of being forced from their homes by river flooding could increase to 50 million a year. More data can be found at: Satellite imaging reveals increased proportion of population exposed to floods | Nature.

## Section 3

What are the ingredients we need for the climate action?

1. **Vision: **the European Green Deal (climate neutrality by 2050)
2. **Mid-term targets: **-55% by 2030 as compared to 1990 
3. **Legislation and policies:** being updated / newly drafted (e.g. the Climate Law)
4. **Policy: **new/updated policies and strategies (e.g. the Adaptation Strategy)

However, one of the most important ingredients is **support and engagement of European citizens** in climate action; here is where the race to climate neutrality will be won or lost.



## Section 4

What is The European Green Deal?

The European Green Deal:

- Sets the EU as a global leader on climate action;
- Transforms the EU's economy for a sustainable future; and
- Leaves no one behind.

**The EU as a global leader**

- Increasing the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050
- Supplying clean, affordable and secure energy
- Mobilising industry for a clean and circular economy
- Building and renovating in an energy and resource efficient way


- Zero- pollution for a toxin-free environment
- Preserving and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity
- From 'Farm to Fork': a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system
- Accelerating the shift to sustainability and smart mobility

It will help guide a 'Just Transition', which **will transform the EU economy for a sustainable future and leave no one behind.**

## Section 5

Watch the video below to hear from Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans as he explains more about the European Climate Pact.



## Section 6

What COVID-19 taught us about climate change

Although full of tragedies on a global scale, COVID-19 has shown us that the impossible is possible. It made us reflect on the future we want to build. COVID-19 made us ask ourselves: should we 'go back to normal' or can we 'build back better' and redefine what is 'normal'? 

There is a need to act urgently, respond according to the latest science and ensure we leave no one behind.

Just like how COVID led to a global response during a time of crisis where we acted together, the European Climate Pact aims to demonstrate that if we join and work together on climate action now, solutions and benefits can be achieved with less disruption and negative side-effects.  

We, humans can as far as possible - 'keep our ways' and use the simultaneous transitions that are happening now, to bring about change for the better: a healthier society, where we do not destroy the planet, while building it. 
To achieve that, governments and industry have a role to play. As a matter of fact, everybody has a role to play as well during this systemic change - no action is too small and every action counts.



## Section 7

What is the European Climate Pact?

As we heard from EVP Timmermans, the European Climate Pact is about awareness and action. It's an opportunity for people, communities and organisations to participate in climate action across Europe.

1. Learn about climate change.
2. Develop and scale up solutions.
3. Connect with others and maximise the impact of these solutions.
4. Support the climate movement.

## Section 8



Why is the European Climate Pact important

We've learned a lot so far about the European Climate Pact, but it's important to know not only  **what** it is, but also  **why**  it's important.

Here are a few reasons:

- It will help improve the way we interact with nature.
- The European Green Deal is responding not only to science, but also to demands for stronger climate action coming from youth, companies and society at large.
- The Pact will connect people from all walks of life.
- It promotes working together, both to tackle climate change and to grasp the opportunities arising from decisive action.
- It also helps with greening the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union.



## Section 9

Who can be an Ambassador and what values do they share?	

Ambassadors come from all walks of life. They are a two-way bridge between their community and network of people they know and the European Commission as well as other Ambassadors. They all share a passion to save our planet as well as some inherent values that bind them together as a community. 

To learn more about the Pact, visit the European Climate Pact (europa.eu). 



Who can be a European Climate Pact Ambassador?

**public administrations** - Regions, cities, local authorities

**civil society** - Local communities, grassroots organizations, activists and advocates, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), philanthropies, charities

**Academia** - Scientific, research and innovation organisations and networks

**Multipliers** - Organisations and networks with existing climate actions

**Citizens** - Consumers, families, households

**Business** - Non- and for-profit, micro, small, medium, and large enterprises, social innovators, investors, trade unions and employers' organisations

**Youth** - Young people aged between 15 and 30

**Education** - Schools, universities, vocational training institutions

**Media** - TV, radio and more

What values do European Climate Pact Ambassadors share?

**Science, responsibility, commitment** -  Participating in the Pact will entail positive climate action, inspiring or encouraging others to join. Participants will contribute with concrete, science-based, trustworthy actions with clear and, ideally, measurable outcomes to show impact.

**Transparency** - Pact participants will commit to sharing relevant information on their actions, methodologies and results with other Pact participants and with the public. This will help participants and others to track progress, make improvements, learn from or join each other's initiatives, and understand the overall impact of the action taken.

**No greenwashing** - Pledges will be registered in such a way as to demonstrate that participants' commitments are concrete, public, and transparent. 

**Ambition and urgency** - To achieve the climate and environmental aims we need to challenge long-standing behaviours and assumptions, quickly and decisively. While every little step counts, Pact participants will also aspire to transformative solutions, including visionary projects, experimentation of novel solutions and innovative ways to cooperate aiming at ambitious or even game changing results.

**Action tailored** - Discussions and action will be adapted to local contexts and target groups. The closer to people's day-to-day reality, the better.

**Diversity and inclusiveness** - To pull down barriers to climate action, including barriers resulting from personal characteristics, such as gender, age and disabilities, anyone, from any background or profession, in principle can take part in the Pact. 



## Section 10

Examples per country:

**The Netherlands**

The Dutch cabinet discusses climate policy with youth every 6 months. Some of the dialogue includes:

*"The Chamber, having heard the debate, considering that the government has explicitly called on young people to help think about and work with it in solving social problems and issues that are becoming more pronounced as a result of the corona crisis; considering that the Young Climate Movement (JKB) is taking up the 'glove' and wants to invest in a 1.5°C society and has concrete ideas about green economic recovery; calls on the government to periodically consult with the JKB and other interested representative groups of young people, and to periodically inform the Parliament about the progress and results,... "*

You can read an example of the framework resolution here.



**Denmark**
The Youth Climate Council advises the Climate Minister and brings new thinking and solutions to the Danish Climate Ministry.Close

**France**

Created a communication campaign on responsible consumption, “Reduce, reuse, recycle," which includes tips, quizzes, etc.  Les bonnes habitudes | Ministère de la Transition écologique (ecologie.gouv.fr)



A city can also be a partner when it comes to the European Climate Pact. This includes the following:

- **With citizens:** participatory budgets, public consultations and dialogues, etc.
- **With businesses: **charging of electric vehicles, waste recycling, etc.
- **With NGOs:** awareness raising and implementation of climate-related actions
- **With academia:** using the local research and innovation 
- **With youth:** capturing the energy and innovative ideas for green transition

Citizens can also take part!

## Section 11

We've learned a lot about the European Climate Pact. Now, let's see the faces of those making the pledge to fight against climate change. Watch the video below to see inspirational stories of Ambassadors taking the pledge.

# Part 2

Visit **The Climate Pact Ambassadors** topic!

## Section 1

What can I do as a European Climate Pact Ambassador?

Government pledges under the Paris Agreement, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are still woefully inadequate to address climate change. Predicted emissions in 2030 leave the world on the path to a 3.2°C increase this century, even if all unconditional NDCs are fully implemented. (Source: UN Emissions Gap Report 2020, 09 Dec. 2020).

But that's where a European Climate Pact Ambassador can help!

As you learn about becoming a European Climate Pact Ambassador, there are 3 goals that you should be aware of and strive to do:

- **Climate action:** no action is too small to make a difference
- **Awareness building:** more people talking about and making climate conscious decisions
- **Campaigning:** growing public support for climate action, pushing policymakers and businesses towards ambitious climate action 

Let's answer a quick question to learn about what you can do as a European Climate Pact Ambassador. You'll learn more about these achievements as you proceed through this topic.

What are different goals you can achieve as a European Climate Pact Ambassador?

![2](C:\Users\tomazk\Desktop\2.png)



## Section 2

Let's discuss achievements for European Climate Pact Ambassadors!

A European Climate Pact Ambassador's main role is to be the "bridge" between "the people" and policy which needs to happen with our government and leaders. This is a two way street – informing the public as well as bringing back their sentiments to policymakers. Pledging and concrete initiatives for addressing climate change helps make a well-rounded Ambassador. 

### Build awareness



- Talk about the need for action and build networks of climate activists.
- Carry the climate message to the so-called lukewarm, who are aware of the impact of climate change, but are not yet taking action.
- Volunteer to inform and mobilise others outside the climate bubble.
- Help us with personal stories and best practice.
- Organise a satellite event.

We need stories, we need projects, we need you! 

### Walk the talk



There are key steps to take to walk the talk. Inspire citizens and communities across Europe to take practical actions in their world to reduce carbon pollution on our planet by taking a step on Count Us In, which has partnered with the European Climate Pact to help citizens take concrete steps from talking to friends, walking and cycling more, reducing food waste, to insulating a home to save energy. Individuals and communities can track how much carbon they've saved, come together with their friends or colleagues to reach carbon saving targets, and challenge others to get involved.
Doing so inspires and helps others to take their steps and makes future steps easier. Share your steps and ask others to follow your lead and do the same!

### Build a community



With a pledge as an organisation or group, you can take action now, whether you are just getting started or are already active and want to do more. Starting with a public commitment is a big step in itself and every community, business, city, charity, institution, club and interest group can make a positive difference. Working together, they can take and multiply actions for a greener and more prosperous planet. The European Climate Pact helps organisations and groups to commit and engage in climate action. 
You can act through your own ecosystem! Invite your communities and networks to join you!

[Climate Pact Day Of Action - How to make an organisational pledge - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJGsuhJOj8c)



### Advocate your green cause



Organize a European Climate Pact Peer Parliament with family members, friends, colleagues, or fellow students. Peer Parliaments are the innovative, decentralized, and deliberative element of citizen participation of the Climate Pact. They are formed by ordinary people who meet in small groups of 5 to 10 people, virtually or fact-to-face. From October to December 2021, the European Commission (DG CLIMA) invites citizens from across Europe to debate, different ways on how to achieve climate-neutrality by 2050 along the following themes:

- How We Move and Get Around
- How We Make Energy Green and Fair
- How We Consume and Eat

The outcomes of the Peer Parliaments will be reflected with policy makers and stakeholders in a series of policy roundtables in 2022. Stay tuned on more information on how you can organise and host a Peer Parliament available to you on the Community Hub after onboarding!
